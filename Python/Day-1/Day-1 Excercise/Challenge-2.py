#print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
#print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
#print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

#Answer: 

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")  # " is missing
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.') # use single quote to avoid error
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")') # avoid space at beginning (indentation error)
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.") # remove ( at first.
